# Chapter 3: Festival of Concord

The midday sun beat down on the polished flagstones of the Grand Forum, the heart of the city, reflecting off the stark white marble of the twin temples dedicated to Aurelion and Varask. Today, the space throbbed with a forced gaiety, thick with the press of bodies celebrating the Festival of Concord. Banners snapped in the breeze – crisp blue and silver for the Wizard’s Guild, blood-red and iron for the Sword-Fighting Academy. The air hummed with a discordant symphony: the drone of official pronouncements from the Civic Council steps, the rhythmic clang of ceremonial Academy drills echoing from the nearby Commons, the sharp, clean scent of Aurelion’s mandated incense attempting to purify the sweat and anxieties of the crowd, and the underlying murmur of a thousand conversations, some laced with reverence, others with resentment.

Syrra Tane stood near the western edge of the Forum, partially shielded by the shadow of a tall pillar commemorating some forgotten battle. Her position offered a clear view of the Academy’s designated demonstration area and multiple escape routes through the thronging crowd – habits ingrained through years of navigating hostile territory. Her face was, as always in public, concealed behind a simple, dark grey mask that covered her nose and mouth, leaving only her eyes visible. Her gaze swept the scene, methodical, analytical. Assessing.

She wasn’t here for the speeches or the spectacle. An illicit merchant, one who occasionally paid well for discreet protection, had business near the Forum today, some whispered deal conducted under the cover of the festival’s noise. Syrra’s job was simple: observe, anticipate trouble, and ensure her client remained breathing and unmolested by rivals or the Watch. But her attention kept drifting towards the Academy’s presence.

Cadets in polished armor marched in rigid formations, their movements synchronized to the barked commands of instructors whose faces were masks of practiced severity. They performed the *Sun Steel Kata*, a sequence designed more for show than practical combat, all flashing blades and dramatic postures meant to impress the watching nobles clustered on the temple steps and the common folk kept back by stern-faced city guards.

Syrra watched their footwork, the angle of their blades, the tension in their shoulders. Flaws. Everywhere. Too much weight on the back foot here, a slight overextension on the lunge there. Dependence on brute force rather than leverage. Confidence bordering on arrogance, bred by institutional privilege, not earned resilience. She recognized the style, the dogma – the same she had once secretly mimicked, then painstakingly unlearned and reforged in the shadows.

Her hand instinctively tightened around the smooth, worn leather wrap at her belt. Beneath it, tucked securely, was the dagger. The hilt, cool against her side even through the layers of her tunic, was a constant, grounding reminder. *Your hand will still be wrong.* The instructor’s voice, a phantom whisper across fifteen years.

She forced her attention back to the crowd. Faces upturned, some filled with awe, others carefully blank. Children perched on parents’ shoulders, eyes wide. Merchants hawked festival tokens. Pickpockets worked the edges. And everywhere, the subtle language of power: the way common citizens automatically stepped aside for anyone bearing an Academy mantle or a Guild cloak; the slight incline of a head, the averted gaze. The city’s enforced order, woven into the very fabric of public movement.

She spotted a few familiar faces from the Threshold District – faces she sometimes saw near the cellar, their expressions carefully neutral as they watched the displays of the institutions that had likely cast them out or denied them entry. A shared glance, a fractional nod almost too small to see – the silent recognition of the marginalized. They knew, as she did, that this festival wasn’t about concord. It was about reinforcing boundaries, about reminding everyone of their place in the rigid hierarchy.

*

Calred Vire hated festivals. He hated the noise, the forced bonhomie, the cloying scent of Aurelion’s incense that always failed to mask the city’s underlying rot. Most of all, he hated the way they threw the Guild’s power – and his own exclusion from it – into sharp relief. Yet here he was, lurking near the edge of the Grand Forum, tucked into the mouth of a narrow alley leading back towards the Threshold District. He leaned against the cool stone, nondescript coat pulled close, trying to make himself as small, as invisible, as possible.

Curiosity, that damnable, unyielding trait, had drawn him out. He’d told himself he needed to gauge the public mood, perhaps pick up whispers of new restrictions or opportunities in the Shadow Market. But the truth, sour and unwelcome, was simpler: he couldn’t stay away. He needed to *see* them. The robed wizards, the strutting apprentices, the tangible manifestation of the life that had been ripped away from him.

From his vantage point, he could see the raised dais where the Guild was preparing its own demonstration. Magister Lyra, head of the Circle of Enchantments, stood poised, her blue-trimmed cloak immaculate, radiating an aura of calm, controlled power. Apprentices flanked her, holding polished silver instruments, their faces masks of intense concentration. The air around the dais felt different, unnaturally still, charged with contained magic. Calred could feel it like a pressure against his skin, a low hum just beneath the threshold of hearing. It made the fillings in his back teeth ache.

He watched as Magister Lyra began the incantation, her voice clear and resonant, amplified by subtle spellcraft. Glyphs flared into existence around the dais – Aurelion’s familiar blue flame, sharp-edged, contained within perfect geometric shapes. Lines of light traced intricate patterns in the air, forming a shimmering dome of protective energy over the designated space. A warding display. Impressive. Predictable. Safe.

*Safe,* Calred thought, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. Safety bought by exclusion, by denying the messy, vibrant chaos that was Mireth’s domain. The chaos they equated with madness. *His* supposed madness.

He saw the crowd’s reaction – murmurs of approval, nods of satisfaction. This was what they paid taxes for, what they surrendered their freedoms for: the illusion of perfect order, maintained by the Guild’s unwavering hand. He saw a father point out the glowing glyphs to his young daughter, her eyes wide with wonder. What stories was he telling her? About the noble wizards protecting the city from unseen evils? Or about the dangers of unsanctioned thought, the "witchcraft" the Guild so carefully associated with female power?

He shifted uncomfortably, the rough weave of his coat scratching against his neck. He felt the familiar phantom itch of the Veiling ceremony, the memory of spiral fire erupting not from careful control, but from an inner vision he couldn’t suppress. The heat, the panic, the shame. The *wrongness*.

His gaze drifted towards the Academy’s display on the far side of the Forum. Two figures now stood in the center of a chalked circle – Academy champions, by the crests on their gleaming breastplates. Nobles, judging by their arrogant bearing. They held practice blades, heavier than the wooden ones Syrra used, but still blunted for the sake of the demonstration. A ceremonial duel. Varask’s domain. Order through combat, loyalty sworn in blood – or, more accurately, sworn by bloodline.

He watched them salute, palm down, fingers extended – *to cut the lie from the air*, the saying went. What lies, Calred wondered. The lie that merit mattered? The lie that women couldn’t wield steel with strength?

The duel began. Fast, aggressive, punctuated by the sharp clang of meeting metal. It was skillful, he had to admit, in a brutal, straightforward way. Power over finesse. Predictable lines of attack. The crowd roared its approval with each parry, each near miss. Aristocratic youths placed bets. Guards watched impassively.

*

Syrra tracked the movements of the duelists, her eyes narrowed. The taller one, broad-shouldered, favored heavy overhead blows, relying on strength. Predictable. Vulnerable to a quick counter-thrust beneath the guard. The other was faster, more agile, but his footwork was sloppy, betraying a lack of true grounding. Both fought with the Academy’s signature arrogance, a belief in their inherent right to dominate the space.

She felt a flicker of the old anger. This was what they valued – pedigree and aggression wrapped in the mantle of discipline. This choreographed violence, presented as the pinnacle of martial prowess, ignored the subtleties of survival, the adaptability needed in a real fight, the lethal efficiency that came not from brute force but from perfect balance and exploiting an opponent’s smallest error.

The taller duelist pressed his advantage, forcing the faster one back towards the edge of the circle. The crowd surged, caught up in the spectacle. Syrra subtly shifted her stance, ensuring her client, the nervous merchant, wasn’t jostled, her hand resting near the hilt of her concealed dagger. Always ready.

Then, something changed. The taller duelist, perhaps feeding off the crowd’s energy or seeking to impress a watching noble – likely Lady Aris, judging by the hawk-like intensity of her gaze from the temple steps – pressed too hard. His lunge was too deep, his recovery a fraction too slow. The faster duelist saw the opening – not for a sanctioned counter, but for something else. A flicker of genuine malice crossed his face, visible even from this distance. Instead of a controlled riposte, he twisted his blade, aiming not for a point award, but for his opponent’s unprotected knee.

It was a violation of the ceremonial rules. A flash of raw, undisciplined aggression breaking through the performance.

Syrra saw it coming a heartbeat before it happened. The deliberate targeting. The intent to injure.

*

Calred sensed it too, not visually, but as a spike in the ambient emotional energy, a jagged shard of malice tearing through the performative aggression. It resonated oddly with the Guild’s carefully constructed ward nearby, creating a dissonant hum that made his skin crawl.

The crowd gasped as the faster duelist struck. The clang of metal was followed by a sickening crunch and a sharp cry of pain. The taller duelist collapsed, clutching his knee, his face contorted. The practice blade clattered onto the flagstones.

For a moment, stunned silence hung over the Forum. Then, chaos erupted.

The injured duelist’s noble family members surged forward, shouting accusations. The other duelist, realizing his transgression, looked panicked, raising his blade defensively. Academy instructors pushed through the crowd, barking orders that were lost in the rising clamor.

Simultaneously, the Guild’s ward, perhaps stressed by the sudden spike of uncontrolled emotion and the proximity of the clashing energies, flickered violently. The perfect blue glyphs stuttered, turning a sickly green, then flared outwards with a sound like tearing silk. Uncontrolled magical energy lashed out – not powerfully destructive, but chaotic, unpredictable. Bolts of blue-green static electricity crackled through the air, striking banners, sending sparks cascading down a nearby statue, and causing fresh waves of panic in the crowd. People screamed, shoved, stumbled. The guards, caught between the dueling debacle and the magical mishap, seemed overwhelmed, their formations breaking as they reacted instinctively rather than cohesively.

The carefully constructed performance of concord shattered into a thousand pieces.

*

Syrra didn’t hesitate. The immediate danger was the panicked crowd trampling the fallen and the escalating confrontation near the dueling circle. Her client forgotten for the moment, she moved. Not like the rigid cadets, but like water flowing around stone. She slipped through the surging bodies, using minimal force, her movements economical and precise.

She saw the faster duelist, wild-eyed now, backing away as the injured man’s kin advanced, swords drawn – real steel this time. An Academy instructor tried to intervene, but was shoved aside. Bloodshed seemed imminent.

With three swift strides, Syrra was there. She didn’t draw her dagger. Instead, she used the flat of her hand in a sharp, percussive strike against the duelist’s sword arm, hitting a nerve cluster. His fingers spasmed, the practice blade falling from his grasp. Before he could react, she spun, using her hip to check the advance of the foremost nobleman, simultaneously stamping hard on the fallen practice blade, sending it skittering away.

It happened in less than two seconds. A blur of controlled motion that momentarily stunned those closest into inaction. She didn't speak, didn't reveal her face. She simply neutralized the immediate threat, creating a vital pause in the escalating violence. In that pause, the Academy instructors finally regained enough composure to bull their way through and physically restrain the involved parties.

As she stepped back, preparing to melt into the chaos, her eyes caught a flicker of movement across the Forum, near the failing Guild ward. Not blue-green static this time. Something else. A brief, impossible pulse of deep crimson light, twisting like smoke, there and gone in an instant. It felt… resonant. Unfamiliar, yet strangely balanced amidst the surrounding magical static. An anomaly. She filed the observation away, her focus already shifting back to navigating the panicked crowd.

*

Calred saw the ward collapse, felt the chaotic discharge wash over the Forum. Instinct, honed by his own disastrous Veiling, took over. He saw a small child stumble and fall near the edge of the erratic energy field, her mother screaming, unable to reach her through the press of bodies.

Without conscious thought, he acted. He couldn’t shield the whole area, couldn’t risk a large, visible display of power. But maybe…

He reached out, not with the rigid control the Guild demanded, but with that other sense, the intuitive flow. He drew on the ambient chaos, gathering the stray threads of panicked energy. His fingers sketched a rapid, complex shape in the air – not a Guild form, but a spiral, folding inwards. He whispered a single word, not from the Prism Codex, but from the forbidden lexicon hinted at in his mother’s hidden books. A word of absorption, of redirection.

For a heartbeat, a spiral flame, crimson and shot through with violet, flickered into existence around his hand, barely visible in the chaotic daylight. It spun inwards, drawing the nearest crackling bolts of static towards it, consuming them silently before vanishing as quickly as it appeared. The air around the fallen child momentarily cleared. Her mother scrambled forward, snatching her up.

Calred stumbled back against the alley wall, heart hammering against his ribs. *Fool!* Exposure. Recklessness. He scanned the surrounding faces, but everyone was focused on the main drama, the failing ward, the injured duelist. Had anyone seen? Had anyone *felt* the signature of his magic? So different from the Guild’s cold fire.

Then, through the swirling chaos, his gaze snagged on a figure across the Forum. A masked individual, moving with uncanny speed and precision near the dueling circle debacle. Not Academy, the movements were too fluid, too reactive. Not Guild, no sign of overt magic. Just… efficient, controlled, dangerous. The figure disarmed the duelist and checked the nobleman’s advance with an economy of motion that spoke of terrifying skill. Then, they melted back into the crowd.

Who was that? Another anomaly in the city’s carefully ordered system. Like his own forbidden fire.

The moment passed. Guild wizards, recovering their composure, finally managed to stabilize the failing ward, though it sputtered fitfully. Academy officers formed a cordon around the duelists, pushing the crowd back. Officials shouted calming platitudes that no one seemed to believe.

The Festival of Concord lay in tatters, its illusion of harmony shattered by uncontrolled aggression and failing magic. The institutions had tried to project strength, but had only revealed their fragility, their inherent instability.

Calred faded deeper into the alley, the adrenaline leaving him shaky. He needed to disappear before anyone started asking questions, before some overzealous Guard patrol decided to scrutinize the fringes. He touched the spiral amulet beneath his coat. The metal felt warm now. Or maybe that was just the frantic beating of his own heart.

Across the Forum, Syrra extracted her pale-faced client from the edge of the chaos, her expression unreadable behind her mask. She too melted away, disappearing into the labyrinthine streets of the Threshold District.

The concord was broken. But in the heart of the chaos, two sparks of unsanctioned power had flared, unseen by most, yet fundamentally altering the energy of the city. Two outcasts, acting independently, had proven more effective than the institutions that scorned them. They hadn’t met, not yet. But the echoes of their actions lingered in the suddenly tense air, ripples spreading outwards from the fractured heart of the festival.
